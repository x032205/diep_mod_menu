# DIEP.IO MOD MENU

I play this game like once or twice a year randomly, so this project will not be that active.

I'm aware of the double-typing issue with the build inputs and am working on it.

## Features
- Build presets
- Custom build codes
- Keep builds on respawn
- Visuals such as aim line, factory circle, fps, collisions, health values
- Auto respawn
- Hide UI

All features persist even after page reload. Configuration is saved to localstorage.
