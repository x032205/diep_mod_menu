# DIEP.IO MOD MENU

I play this game like once or twice a year randomly, so this project will not be that active.

I'm aware of the double-typing issue with the build inputs and am working on it.

## Features
- Type custom builds into a text input
- Have non-stop build pre-setting, even on respawn
- Visuals such as aim line and factory guide circle
